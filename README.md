# Project Overview

This project is a web application that integrates a Python Flask backend with various parsing and lexical analysis tools generated using Flex and Bison. It provides a web interface for interacting with these tools, showcasing different functionalities from arithmetic calculation to variable extraction.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python 3.x**: For the backend logic and web server.
*   **Flask**: Web framework for the Python backend.
*   **Flex**: A fast lexical analyzer generator, used to create C source code for tokenizing input.
*   **Bison**: A general-purpose parser generator, used to create C source code for parsing grammars.
*   **GCC (or compatible C compiler)**: To compile the C code generated by Flex and Bison.
*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the web-based user interface.

## Project Structure

-   `email_parser.c`: A standalone C program designed for parsing email-related data, demonstrating basic parsing techniques outside the Flex/Bison framework.
-   `.vscode/`: Contains Visual Studio Code configuration files for development, including settings for C/C++ and launch configurations.
-   `backend/`:
    -   `app.py`: The core of the Python Flask web application. It handles HTTP requests, serves the web interface, and orchestrates calls to the Flex/Bison programs through `flex_bison_utils.py`.
    -   `flex_bison_utils.py`: A utility module providing Python functions to manage and interact with the compiled Flex/Bison programs. This might include compiling, executing, and capturing output from the C executables.
    -   `interpreter_logic.py`: Contains the business logic for processing the results obtained from the Flex/Bison programs, potentially transforming raw output into a more structured or user-friendly format for the web interface.
    -   `flex_bison_programs/`: This directory houses various specialized parsers and lexers built using Flex and Bison. Each subdirectory is a self-contained project demonstrating a specific parsing or lexical analysis task:
        -   `arithmetic_calculator`: Parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.
        -   `boolean_evaluator`: Evaluates boolean expressions.
        -   `calculator`: A basic calculator.
        -   `error_simulator`: Designed to simulate and handle parsing errors.
        -   `keyword_identifier`: Identifies keywords in a given input text.
        -   `lexer_features`: Demonstrates various features and capabilities of Flex lexers.
        -   `printf_extractor`: Extracts `printf` function calls and their arguments from C code.
        -   `semantic_action_simulator`: Illustrates how semantic actions are integrated into parsing.
        -   `var_extractor`: Extracts variable declarations and usages from code.
        -   `variable_declarations`: Specifically focuses on parsing and identifying variable declarations.
    -   `static/`: Contains static web assets directly served to the client.
        -   `script.js`: Provides interactive functionality for the web interface, sending user input to the backend and dynamically updating the display with results.
        -   `style.css`: Defines the visual styling and layout of the web application.
    -   `templates/`: Holds HTML template files rendered by the Flask application.
        -   `index.html`: The main user interface template, displaying input forms and areas for results.
        -   `Input.txt`: A placeholder or example input file, potentially used for testing or demonstration.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Python 3.x**
-   **Flex** (e.g., `sudo apt-get install flex` on Linux, or via Scoop/Chocolatey on Windows)
-   **Bison** (e.g., `sudo apt-get install bison` on Linux, or via Scoop/Chocolatey on Windows)
-   **GCC (or a compatible C compiler)** (e.g., `sudo apt-get install build-essential` on Linux, MinGW on Windows)

### Backend (Python) Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
    (It's recommended to use a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows, or `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS)

### Flex/Bison Programs Compilation

Each Flex/Bison program in `backend/flex_bison_programs/` must be compiled into an executable. This process involves generating C code from `.l` and `.y` files, and then compiling that C code.

For each program (e.g., `arithmetic_calculator`):

1.  **Navigate to the specific program directory**:
    ```bash
    cd backend/flex_bison_programs/arithmetic_calculator
    ```
2.  **Generate lexer (lex.yy.c) and parser (parser.tab.c, parser.tab.h) C files**:
    ```bash
    flex arithmetic_calculator.l
    bison -d arithmetic_calculator.y
    ```
3.  **Compile the generated C code**:
    ```bash
    gcc arithmetic_calculator.tab.c lex.yy.c -o arithmetic_calculator.exe
    ```
    (Note: Some programs might require additional flags or linking libraries. Adjust `gcc` command as necessary.)

You will need to repeat these steps for all the Flex/Bison programs you intend to use or interact with via the Python backend. The `flex_bison_utils.py` module might contain helper functions to automate this compilation process across all programs.

## Running the Application

### Running the Python Backend

1.  **Navigate back to the main `backend` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Run the Flask application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically start a development server accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or similar, as indicated in the console output).

### Running Individual Flex/Bison Programs (Optional)

You can test the compiled `.exe` files directly from their respective directories after compilation, providing input via standard input or a file.

Example with `arithmetic_calculator`:

```bash
cd backend/flex_bison_programs/arithmetic_calculator
echo "2 + 3 * 5" | ./arithmetic_calculator.exe
# Or with a file:
./arithmetic_calculator.exe < input_expression.txt
```
(Replace `input_expression.txt` with a file containing an arithmetic expression.)

## Usage

Once the Python backend is running, open your web browser and navigate to the displayed address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`). The web interface (`index.html` and `script.js`) will allow you to input data, select which parser/lexer to use, send the request to the Flask backend, and display the processed results.

## `email_parser.c`

This is a standalone C file, separate from the Flex/Bison generated programs. It can be compiled and run independently.

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory**:
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\siyam\OneDrive\Desktop\project_cod\
    ```
2.  **Compile**:
    ```bash
    gcc email_parser.c -o email_parser.exe
    ```
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    ./email_parser.exe < input_email.txt
    ```
    (Replace `input_email.txt` with a file containing email content that `email_parser.c` is designed to parse.)
